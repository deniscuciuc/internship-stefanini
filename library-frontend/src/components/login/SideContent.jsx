                        Most of the time books are better than movies. Books can let you imagine the setting or events
                        happening in the story. They are also more detailed than movies because movies sometimes leave
                        out some important details.

                        In some movies, they switch up the characters because in the book they are different and totally
                        the opposite.

                        When we read a book, we tend to visualize the characters a certain way and in movies they don’t
                        look like the way we want them too. It disappoints us in many ways. I’ve read books before that
                        have a plot twist at the end and in the movie it never happens.
